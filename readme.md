# Razorpay Clone

This is a simple Razorpay clone built using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and a bit of JavaScript. The project aims to replicate the look and feel of the Razorpay payment gateway UI, focusing on providing a clean, responsive, and user-friendly experience.

## Features

- **Modern UI**: A sleek, modern design using Tailwind CSS for styling.
- **Payment Gateway Interface**: Mimics the appearance and flow of the Razorpay payment interface.
- **Interactive Forms**: Basic interactive forms for payment processing (not integrated with real payment API).
- **Lightweight**: Minimal HTML and CSS for fast loading and a smooth user experience.

## Technologies Used
